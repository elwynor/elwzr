--==================================--
  Zone RAIDERS!  MultiPlayer COMBAT!
--==================================--

     Zone RAIDERS! is a multi-player combat game originally based on the
"survivalist" camps popular in the early 80's.  Players here are given the
opportunity to be really hostile to each other with no real-life side
effects.

     Zone RAIDERS! takes place in REAL TIME, on a 50 by 50 square grid.
Each grid position is a place you can stand, so there are 2500 different
locations in the game.  Everyone has HEALTH and ENERGY POINTS.  As you are
attacked, your health decreases.  You never heal (without assistance) in
Zone RAIDERS!, because the time span of the game is too short to allow it
to happen in real life.  If your health goes below zero, you die, and are
out of the game.

     A player may carry up to 10 items, including one gun-type weapon.
Everyone has a knife, even though it does not appear on the inventory.

     EP is short for ENERGY POINTS.  When you fire your weapon, it uses up
energy.  Energy points regenerate, 1 every 2 seconds.  The number of EP
used when you fire depends on your weapon, and ranges from 3 to 16 per
shot.  It is best to be judicious with your weapon, or you will run out
of EP very quickly.

     In Zone RAIDERS, you can move and fire in 8 different directions.
These are: N, NW, W, SW, S, SE, E and NE.

     When you move, you make noise.  That noise can and will be heard by
any player close enough to hear it.  You can move by RUNNING (very loud),
WALKING (fairly quiet) or CRAWLING (nearly silent).  You can also make
yourself heard bu speaking.  You have a choice of three speaking volumes.
You can YELL, TALK or WHISPER.
         
     Everyone has a two-channel radio.  You can use the "General" channel
which everyone can hear, or the "Loyal" channel, which only people on your
side can hear.  Remember: Speaking into your radio can ALSO be heard.

     Everyone starts the game with the Basic weapon (pulse pistol).  Every
shot you score on someone, you earn 3 "bux".  If you kill someone, you earn
15 "bux".  You can go to the supply depots (located at 00 W10 and 00 E10)
to purchase various items with your bux, like better weapons, medikits and
the like.  Better weapons can fire with more power (using more EP per shot)
and do more damage.  Better weapons also are quieter (weapon fire can be
heard), but have a shorter range.

     There are two sides: ALPHA and BRAVO.  You choose which side you want
to play when you enter the game.  It makes no difference in the game who
you shoot, indeed, if you are playing teams, you MUST use your loyal radio
and whispering to make sure you don't shoot an ally!

     You can play the game any number of ways:  As a two-sided war.  As a
everyman-for-himself free-for-all.  You can even challenge someone to a
duel.  However, the game knows nothing of HOW you play it, it just keeps
track of two sides, with a loyal radio channel exclusive to that.  It's up
to YOU to create the scenario you want to play --- Zone RAIDERS enables you
to be very creative in your game play.

     The reason all this is based on "sound" as it were, is that the game
is played at night, in a lightly wooded forest.  Ergo, running is very loud
as the player trips over bushes, runs into branches, etc.

     Also, while "sound levels" were mentioned, and "ranges" for weapons,
you were NOT told what these were.  You have to discover all these factors
for yourself.  That is what separates the beginner from the expert Zone
RAIDERS! player.

     When you exit the game, no matter how, you are assigned a score.
Depending on how you exit the game, you're assigned a "status".  If you
left the game before all the players on the other team were dead, you are
"AWOL", and your score is divided by three.  If you die, you are "Killed
in Service" and receive your full score.  If you exit the game, but there
are no players on the other team, you receive an "Honorable Discharge,"
and your full score.

  1)  Nothing is printed to your screen for "fun."  Every message you see
      has some meaning.  Don't ignore any part of the text display.

  2)  Weapons can jam.

  3)  If you're LOOKING, and get shot, you won't see anything.

  4)  Usage of landmines:  Just <U>se them.  They rest on the current
      square.  It won't go off until someone moves onto the square.

  5)  Usage of grenades:  <U>se it, then <T>hrow it.  If you don't throw
      it, it will blow up in the square you're in.

  6)  You receive no bux or score for using landmines or grenades.

  7)  Alpha players start out near 15N 0E, Bravo near 15S 0E.

  8)  Landmines go dud in 10 minutes.
